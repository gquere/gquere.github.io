title: Privescing a BitLocker + PIN-Encrypted Company Laptop
---

![Another round of TPM sniffing using a DSLogic logic analyzer](./BitLockerPIN/connect.jpg)

In [part 1](https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker.html) we focused on recovering the BitLocker encryption key on a laptop that had no PIN protection, for instance if the laptop gets briefly accessed by an attacker or simply stolen.

There will be no proper "bypassing" this time since the attacker needs to know the PIN. The attacker is now an insider that wants to get SYSTEM access. So we're going to unlock the laptop's drive and discuss a few peculiarities found along the way. There is nothing new presented here, except what to do when the tools fail.

PIN-protected BitLocker
-----------------------
How does a PIN- *or passphrase-*protected BitLocker differ from the commonly encountered TPM-only (aka auto-deciphering) BitLocker?

The FVEK, which is the actual disk encryption key is still on the disk next to the encrypted data and it is still encrypted with the VMK.

The VMK is now stored on the disk instead of on the TPM. Of course it cannot be stored in plaintext so it's encrypted using an Intermediate Key (IK). The IK key is stored encrypted in the TPM using the Stretched Key (SK). And finally the SK is derived from the user's PIN.

![BitLocker with PIN unseal TPM Architecture](./BitLockerPIN/archi.png)

The PIN is used twice:

* to authenticate to the TPM and unseal the encrypted IK
* to derive a key that will decrypt the TPM's response and get the plaintext IK

This ensures that it's impossible to brute force the PIN both online (since the TPM has a locking mechanism) and offline (since the disk key is not encrypted with the possibly weak PIN but with an intermediate random key).


HP ProBook 4 G1's TPM
---------------------
After removing the back cover and not immediately identifying a discrete TPM chip, I was confused and left wondering: "Is there really no more discrete TPM on these high-end laptops? Have they finally moved away from FIPS 140-2 and used a more secure fTPM?".
![where's the TPM?](./BitLockerPIN/layout.jpg)

Well, the answer is a resounding "No": pulling out the whole motherboard confirms that they still use that Nuvoton NPCT760HABYX chip:
![Nuvoton NPCT7 TPM on motherboard's backside of HP ProBook 4](./BitLockerPIN/tpm.jpg)

This TPM communicates over SPI, probably the most common protocol for laptop TPMs. SPI is a shared bus, therefore there's a good chance that one or more memory chips are on the same bus but on the other, visible, side of the PCB. This is trivially verified using a multimeter in continuity mode.

On the HP ProBook 4, the best candidate is right next to the RAM, an MX25U chip with very convenient test through holes into which I placed pins:
![SPI sniff](./BitLockerPIN/connect2.jpg)

Blue is the clock, green and yellow are MOSI and MISO. Red is CS but it doesn't actually matter. On older versions of DSView this caused the SPI parsers to fail, but they now ignore a missing CS.

We're now set up for a capture.


The weirdest of clocks
----------------------
The first problem I noticed was a strange clock that was driven high during dead times:
![Fucked SPI clock](./BitLockerPIN/fucked_clock.png)

The oscilloscope confirmed the issue: the clock line was sitting idle at an intermediate voltage:
![No better SPI clock](./BitLockerPIN/oscillo.jpg)

The solution is simple: use a 4.7kÎ© pulldown resistor on the clock bus to force the line low when it's not driven.


A weirder capture still
-----------------------
The TIS protocol is used to send one byte per packet. So how come there are 2 bytes here?
![SPI bus with pulldown resistor added](./BitLockerPIN/2_bytes.png)

I suspect that this is the acknowledgment being slow to send or understand which causes the data byte to be reemitted. This causes the TPM parser to completely fail:
![DSView parser failing](./BitLockerPIN/decoder_fail.png)

Also, the responses encapsulations don't make sense (```FF FF FF``` should probably be something like ```80 00 00```), maybe that's another pulldown that needs to be installed? But in the end it doesn't matter since the last byte of the packet is always right and it's the only one used.

We will once again have to decode manually but that's no big deal because thanks to the PIN, we know exactly where to look for the TPM commands (recall from part 1 that the capture was several million bytes), since we're starting the capture right before sending the PIN, when there is no more activity on the bus. It's actually a simpler attack!

It was pointed out to me by @en4rab that selecting the TPM1.2 instead of 2.0 decoder correctly decodes the packet (though I can confirm that the DUT is indeed a TPM2.0). But since there are a few bitflips due to noise in my captured sample, the decoder still fails overall as it expects a perfect capture. So we'll still go the manual route!

Use the "save decoded data as" option of DSView to save separate MOSI and MISO lines. Use a regex to remove all TIS communications, for master that's ```00 D4 00 18 XX``` and for slave that's ```FF FF FF FE 01```. After that, separate lines at TPM message headers ```80 01``` (normal session) and ```80 02``` (authenticated session). Master to slave is denoted with a '>' and slave to master with a '<'.

Comparing captures and determining PIN usage
--------------------------------------------
I've compared a bunch of captures with good and bad PINs: the PIN is actually never sent to the TPM! I'm 99% sure that it's used in the calculation of the unseal HMAC because that's the only value that changes. This doesn't seem to be documented anywhere.


Recovering the VMK
------------------
Okay we've finally grabbed the ```TPM_CC.Unseal``` command's response. But the response buffer doesn't look like something we're used to. On the left side is a non-PIN-protected BitLocker, on the right side is the captured PIN-protected one.
![Classic BitLocker vs PIN BitLocker](./BitLockerPIN/tpm_response_comparison.png)

The IK that protects the VMK is encrypted within this blob, using the SK derived from the PIN.

First, the SK needs to be derived from the PIN. The latter is UTF-16LE encoded, hashed twice, then 0x100000 rounds of SHA256 with the disk's salt are applied to it:
```python
import hashlib

# hash PIN twice
pin = '67851922'.encode('utf-16-le')
pinh = hashlib.sha256(pin).digest()
pinh = hashlib.sha256(pinh).digest()

# key stretching
h = bytes.fromhex('00' * 32)
salt = bytes.fromhex('c36496f98842c6fd9841de2ea743d5cf')    # from dislocker -vvvv output, "STRETCH KEY salt"
for i in range(0, 0x100000):
    h = hashlib.sha256(h + pinh + salt + i.to_bytes(8, byteorder='little')).digest()

print("SK:", h.hex())
```

The derived SK is now used to decrypt the buffer received from the TPM that was captured earlier to get IK:
```python
from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES

SK = bytes.fromhex("112a35c30dca7f30306d6a55e05d93719c7db79345520d6c7116c16e29616db2")
message = bytes.fromhex("5000000005000000"          # message header
                        "000A26106234DC0134000000"  # nonce
                        "124712A6F976ED48DBA49BA1E58744A9" # MAC, unused
                        "46C07032F2781AEBD065FCC19D6D118353C6E6738D94FDB0EBE8B13D91A58AE384B6C0604A60C5A70272958D") # encrypted IK
cipher = AES.new(SK, AES.MODE_CCM, nonce=message[8:8+12])
print("IK:", cipher.decrypt(message[36:36+44]).hex())
```

Decrypting the VMK requires finding its datum on the disk; the simplest way is to use dislocker. Here's an example of its output:
```
dislocker -vvvv /dev/loop7p3
...
Total datum size: 0x0050 (80) bytes
Datum entry type: 0
   `--> ENTRY TYPE UNKNOWN 1
Datum value type: 5
   `--> AES-CCM -- Total size header: 36 -- Nested datum: no
Status: 0x1
Nonce:
00 0a 26 10 62 34 dc 01 35 00 00 00
MAC:
5f 7b 3a c2 ec 32 d5 cf 55 e7 fa 25 9c b1 c0 d5
Payload:
0x00000000 fe 1e 50 87 52 fb ca 8a-6a e1 ce 8d 67 f4 0e f7
0x00000010 72 79 28 51 30 0c b5 94-05 27 30 97 c7 4e be c6
0x00000020 ed 98 25 79 e8 64 80 34-22 47 1d 76
Header safe: 0x50, 0, 0x5, 0x1
```

The same exact decryption process covered for IK applies to the VMK using the values read in the datum. With this you can now decrypt and mount the disk still using dislocker. Privilege escalation from there is left to the reader.

There are [a bunch](https://github.com/en4rab/SPITkey/blob/main/SPITkey.py) [of scripts](https://github.com/scrt/tpm_sniffing_pin/blob/main/tpm_sniffing_pin.py) that do all of this automatically. One of them directly reads the info from the volume, while the other one uses dislocker to extract the disk data as presented above. Anyway in the end it just works and is cleaner than my own code. And that's it!
