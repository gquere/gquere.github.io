This is my writeup to the 2020 SSTIC's challenge.

The SSTIC is the biggest french security conference. Its annual challenge is generally considered a difficult reversing challenge that involves fun technologies.

Looking back on the past few weeks, I think it took me more than 120 hours to solve the whole challenge, which is gargantuous. Nevertheless, it's the first year I manage to finish it so I'm really happy. Note that I'm a novice reverser and this year's winner has flagged all steps in 36 hours total, gratz to you @0xf4b.

I'm not spoiling you the technologies involved yet, they're quite fun and it's a part of the challenge to discover them on the go. If you're a hardcode reverse, jump to step 4.

Here are the 6 steps:

* [Step 1]: Forensics / Easy
* [Step 2]: Forensics / Easy
* [Step 3]: Reverse / Easy
* [Step 4]: Reverse / Hard
* [Step 5]: Reverse / Medium
* [Step 6]: Reverse / Hard
