title: SSTIC challenge 2020 writeup
---

This is my writeup for the 2020 SSTIC's challenge.

The SSTIC is the biggest french security conference. Its annual challenge is generally considered to be a difficult reversing challenge that involves fun technologies.

Looking back on the past few weeks, I think it took me more than 120 hours to solve the whole challenge, which is gargantuous. Nevertheless, it's the first year I managed to finish it so I'm really happy. Note that I'm a novice reverser whereas this year's winner has flagged all steps in 36 hours total, gratz to you @0xf4b.

I'm not spoiling you the technologies involved yet, they're quite fun and it's a part of the challenge to discover them on the go. If you're a hardcode reverser, jump to step 4.

Here are the 6 steps:

* [Step 1: Forensics / Easy](./step1)
* [Step 2: Forensics / Easy](./step2)
* [Step 3: Reverse / Easy](./step3)
* [Step 4: Reverse / Hard](./step4)
* [Step 5: Reverse / Medium](./step5)
* [Step 6: Reverse / Hard](./step6)
